# Glitcher of Sorts

A glitch art effect processor.

**this project is incomplete** and probably always will be, but I found this repo recently and decided to open source it anyway.
It looks like I had effects working, with some neat options, and effect queues, but you don't seem to be able to remove effects from the queue, or save the result, or really do much at all...
